# SoundCloud-Profile-Backup
A simple php script to display information about a SoundCloud account in JSON format

![Soundcloud Profile Backup UI][1]

#### I recommend using JSONView (Available on [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/jsonview/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en)) or using [JSON Editor Online](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/)

Note: The secure.php file is just a place for the `$client_id` variable which was given from SoundCloud's Developer App Dashboard
